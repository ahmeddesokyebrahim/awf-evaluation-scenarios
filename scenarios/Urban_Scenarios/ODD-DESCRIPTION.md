### Purpose of Dense Urban Area Operational Design Domain (ODD)

The **Dense Urban Area ODD** aims to enhance Autoware's capabilities for comfortable and safe driving in low-speed urban traffic conditions. The primary goal is to enable the autonomous vehicle to navigate complex urban environments effectively, considering the unique challenges presented by such areas.

### Scope of the Scenarios

The scenarios within this ODD will encompass various urban driving conditions that include:

1. **Vehicles Moving Outside Lanelets**: Scenarios where vehicles partially or entirely deviate from their designated lanes.
2. **Areas with Unclear Traffic Rules**: Intersections and roads lacking explicit traffic signals and right-of-way indicators.
3. **High Presence of Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs)**: Situations with significant pedestrian, cyclist, and other non-motorized traffic.
4. **Mixed-Use Roads**: Roads actively used by pedestrians in the absence of dedicated pedestrian crossings or sidewalks.
5. **Two-Way and One-Way Roads**: Roads where traffic flows in both directions and one-way streets where vehicles may occasionally appear from the opposite direction.

### Categories of Scenarios

The Dense Urban Area ODD scenarios are categorized into three main groups:

1. **No Traffic Rules (NTR)**
    - **Characteristics**:
        - Areas with indistinct or nonexistent traffic regulations.
        - Other road users may not adhere strictly to traffic laws.
        - Absence of traffic lights and clear right-of-way.
        - Examples include intersections without traffic signals and improper overtaking by other vehicles.
    - **Objective**:
        - Ensure Autoware can navigate these areas safely, recognizing and adapting to potentially erratic behaviors of other road users.

2. **Vulnerable Road Users (VRU)**
    - **Characteristics**:
        - Scenarios involving pedestrians, cyclists, and motorized two-wheelers.
        - Unpredictable and potentially hazardous movements by these users.
    - **Objective**:
        - Enable Autoware to detect and respond appropriately to VRUs, minimizing risks and ensuring safe passage through areas densely populated with these users.

3. **Dense Urban (DU)**
    - **Characteristics**:
        - High-density traffic with various types of road users.
        - Congested environments with frequent interactions.
        - Ambiguous right-of-way situations requiring the vehicle to yield appropriately.
    - **Objective**:
        - Equip Autoware with the ability to manage densely populated urban settings, maintaining safety and efficiency while navigating through high traffic volumes and complex interactions.

### Features Required for Autoware

To handle the outlined scenarios, Autoware must be equipped with the following features:

1. **Advanced Perception and Recognition**:
    - Ability to detect and classify various road users, including vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists.
    - Recognition of non-standard traffic patterns and road usage.

2. **Robust Decision-Making Algorithms**:
    - Decision-making capabilities to handle ambiguous traffic rules and right-of-way situations.
    - Strategies to deal with unpredictable behaviors of other road users.

3. **Efficient Path Planning and Navigation**:
    - Path planning that accounts for potential deviations from lanelets and dynamic obstacles.
    - Navigation algorithms that ensure smooth and safe driving without unnecessary delays.

4. **Adaptive Speed Control and Maneuvering**:
    - Speed control mechanisms to handle low-speed urban driving efficiently.
    - Safe maneuvering techniques for overtaking, yielding, and negotiating dense traffic.

5. **Safety and Collision Avoidance**:
    - Comprehensive collision avoidance systems to prevent accidents with other vehicles and VRUs.
    - Implementation of safety protocols for emergency scenarios and unexpected obstacles.
